My name is Nathan Phetteplace, and I am a software engineer living in Fort Worth, Texas. I have
a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University (gigem) and am currently employed by
[rewardStyle](https://www.rewardstyle.com/) as the Engineering Manager of the team responsible
for the [LIKEtoKNOW.it](https://www.liketoknow.it/) back end services and website.

# About this Site

This site was created to provide a location to lay out my thoughts, experiences, and learnings
in software and technology. I find that teaching has been the best way to learn. Posting content
for others encourages that mindset so that I can further my own understanding.
